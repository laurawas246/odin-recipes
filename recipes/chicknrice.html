        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Easy one pan Spanish chicken and rice is made with simple seasoning that come together with zesty bold flavors in this one pot, 30 minute meal.</p>
            <p>This meal will take about 5 minutes to prep and 25 minutes to cook.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts - OR 6 chicken thighs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons vegetable or canola oil</li>
                <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups low sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 lemon</li>
                <li>chopped cilantro or parsley - for garnish</li>
                </ul>  
            <h3>Spanish seasoning mix</h3>    
                <ul> 
                <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon coriander - (see note)</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a small bowl whisk together all ingredients for the Spanish seasoning mix. Divide in half and set aside. Cut the lemon in half, then thinly slice one half - for garnish - and reserve the other half for juicing later in the recipe.</li>
                    <li>Place chicken in a medium bowl. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil, then toss to coat well. Use half of the prepared seasoning mix to rub on both sides of each piece of chicken.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle a large skillet with remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and bring to medium heat. Cook chicken for 2-3 minutes on each side until browned. Transfer to a plate. (It won't be cooked through at this point)</li>
                    <li>Add rice, chicken broth, juice from 1/2 of the lemon, and remaining seasoning mix and stir to combine. Return chicken to the pan on top of the rice. Cover and cook for 20-25 minutes until liquid is absorbed, rice is tender, and chicken is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with lemon slices and freshly chopped cilantro or parsley and serve immediately</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Notes</h3>
                <p>Coriander is found in the spice section of any typical grocery store. In a pinch, cumin can be used as a substitute. </p>
