        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Creamy broccoli cheddar soup is comfort food at its best and this Panera's Broccoli Cheddar Soup is an easy dinner that hits the spot.</p>
        <p>This soup will take about 10 minutes to prep and 25 minutes to cook.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup melted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 medium chopped onion</li>
                <li>1/4 cup flour</li>
                <li>2 cups half-and-half cream</li>
                <li>2 cups chicken stock or broth</li>
                <li>1/2 lb broccoli, (about 3 cups), chopped into bite size pieces</li>
                <li>1 cup carrot, , julienned (can buy matchstick carrots in produce section)</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, (optional but brings out the flavor)</li>
                <li>8 ounces grated sharp cheddar cheese, (2 cups)</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Melt the 1/4 cup butter and sautee the onions in it until soft. Sprinkle the flour over the mixture. Cook and stir over medium heat for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk in the half & half and chicken stock.</li>
                <li>Add the broccoli and carrots. Cook over low heat for 20-25 minutes or until the broccoli and carrots are tender.</li>
                <li>Add salt and pepper. You can leave the soup chunky or blend about 1 cup of the soup and stir it in for a smoother soup (that's what I do). Return to low heat and add the cheese. If your heat is too high your soup can get grainy. Stir in the nutmeg if desired.</li>
                <li>Serve with crusty bread.</li>
            </ol>
